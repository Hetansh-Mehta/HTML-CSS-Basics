HTML/CSS - BASICS

HTML STRUCTURE PART 1

1)  <tag>content</tag>

	▪	 There are many tags in HTML and each one represents different type of elements.
	▪	 Between the opening and closing tag comes the content. The content is the stuff that people will see in the browser.
	▪	Notice below that the images do not have a closing tag. Its a special one.


Here are a few tags:
	•	<p> This is a paragraph. </p>
	•	<h1> This is a heading. </h1>
	•	<span> This is a span. </span>
	•	<img src=“image.jpg” alt=“a picture” >
	•	<em> em stands for emphasis which makes texts italic </em>
	•	<strong> stands for bold </strong>
Every type of element display’s differently on the web .

Writing comments:
<!—
This is a comment. Note the special tags. Comments are useful for leaving notes for ourselves or for other people to read.
—>

Exercise 1:

Make three elements:
* one paragraph
* two spans
Make sure to put some text content in every element!
<tag>content</tag> is an example element


Solution:
<p> Hey, I’m Hetansh </p>
<span> I love soccer </span>
<span> and I’m learning web dev </span>


Inheritance:
<div> content </div>
	▪	Elements can go inside other elements.
	▪	Contents isn’t just text, it can contain elements as well .

Example:
<div> <h1> Article Title </h1> <p> paragraph of text </p> </div>

Here: <div> is the parent and <h1> and <p> are the children. It is often represented as a tree.

This can also be written as (more clearly):
<div>
	<h1> Article Title </h1>
	<p> Paragraph of text. </p>
</div>

HTML STRUCTURE PART 2

<! DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset=“utf-a”>
		<title> HTML Structure </title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1> This is a heading. </h1>
	</body>
</html>

	▪	We know the above code just displays the heading: “This is a heading”
	▪	However, we must follow a standard method of web developing

Every HTML document we create or load is derived from the above mentioned basic format (template).
The template does not only say what should be displayed, but also includes relevant information that tells the browser how to display it.

	▪	DOCTYPE: describes the type of HTML. While there are technically different types, for 99.999% of the HTML that we write,
             we’ll be fine with <! DOCTYPE html>
	▪	<head>: describes the meta information (metadata) about the site, such as the title, and provides links to scripts
            and stylesheets the site needs to render and behave correctly.
	▪	<body>: describes the actual content of the site that the users will see.

Metadata contains information about the page/site. This includes information about styles,
scripts and data to help software (search engines, browsers, etc) use and render the page.

HTML DOCUMENTS IN DEPTH

	✓	An HTML document will usually start with a type declaration (which is not a tag, so it should not have a closing tag).
    The declaration helps the browser determine what type of HTML document it’s trying to parse and display.

	Older Example:
	<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC =-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN” “http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd”>
	(Triggers Standards mode but specifies an older form of validation.)

	Maybe we didn’t see a doctype at all?
	<html>
	….
	</html>
	(Triggers “Quirks” mpde. This is bad)

	Newer Websites:
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	(Triggers standards mode with all updated features.)

	Browsers look for this doctype declaration to determine which rendering mode to use to render the site.
  Generally, 	newer sites follow standard HTML specifications. The current standard HTML specification is called HTML5.

	✓	<html> tag, which tells the browser that everything enclosed inside the
  <html>
   …. . .. . .
   </html>
   should be parsed as HTML.

   Then we have two main sections of the HTML document:
	<head> and <body>

	✓	<head> and <body>  :
	⁃	The <head> will contain general information and metadata about the page, while
    the <body> will contain the contents that will be displayed on the page.
	⁃	The <body is always visible.
	⁃	The <head>  is never visible, but the information in it describes the page and links to other files the browser
  needs to render the website correctly.

  The head is responsible for:

			I) The document’s title (the text that shows up in browser tabs):
				<title> about me </title>
			The above tag will define the title of the document and will be displayed in the tab of the browser window
      when a user visits the page

     ii) Associated CSS file (for style)
				<link rel= “stylesheet”
				type = “text/css”
				href= “style.css”>

		iii) Associated JavaScript files (multipurpose scrips to change rendering and behavior)
				<script src=“animations.js”>
				</script>

		iv) Charset being used (the text’s encoding):
				<meta charset-“utf-8”>
			The above tag is pretty standard, and allows our website to display any Unicode character.

		v) Keywords, authors and descriptions(often useful for SEO):
				<meta name = “description”
				content = “This is what my website is all about!”>

✓	HTML Validators
	Analyze the website and verify that we’re writing valid HTML.

*) MAKE A BUTTON ELEMENT
    A button element represents a clickable button, which can be used in forms
    or anywhere in a document that needs simple, standard button functionality.

    Syntax: <button> Text </button>

*) Hyperlinks
  <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>

<! DOCTYPE html>
<html>

  <head>

    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title> HTML/CSS </title>

  </head>
  <!-- Head contains the meta data -->

  <body>

    <h1> Basics of HTML and CSS </h1>
    <!--
    <h2> This is heading 2 </h2>
    <h3> This is heading 3 </h3>
    <h4> This is heading 4 </h4>
    -->
<!-- Using the above header tags, we can classify information based on importance -->
<p> Headers are a great way to visually break up
    the web page, as well as to indicate the relative
    importance of various elements </p>

    <h2> Unordered and Ordered Lists </h2>
    <p> An unordered list usually displays list items with bullet points </p>
    <ul>  <!-- Syntax of Unordered list -->
      <li> ABC </li>
      <li> DEF </li>  <!-- <li> represents an item in the list -->
      <li> GHI </li>
    </ul>

    <p> An ordered list is displays list items with an ascending counter on the left,
        such as a number or letter</p>
    <ol>  <!-- Syntax of Ordered list -->
      <li> ABC </li>
      <li> DEF </li>
      <li> GHI </li>
    </ol>

<!-- Tree to HTML
    *) Add an <h1> tag with some content
    *) Add a <div> tag.
    *) Add two paragraph tags a child elements to the <div>
-->
    <h2> Tree Structures / Inheritance </h2>

    <div>
      <p> We now use the tree structures to organize our HTML document
          into meaningful sections </p>
      <p> This is helpful for readability and to provide a consistent
          structure for styling and programmatic control with CSS and
          JavaScript </p>
    </div>

    <h2> Button Element </h2>
    <button> Button 1 </button>

    <h2> Hyperlinks </h2>
    <p> The power of the web is that pages can lead to other pages.
        When we click a link on a web page, it takes us to another page.
        This link is called a
        <strong> hyperlink </strong>
    <p> Hyperlinks are created using anchor elements, which generally look like: </p>

    <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a>
    <span> This is the hyperlink leading to google's homepage </span>

    <p> Inside the opening a tag there is href, which stands for "reference".
        This is called an <strong> attribute </strong> .
        Attributes like href describe the properties of HTML elements.
        In this case, the href attribute is the target URL that the link will open.
        The content inside the anchor element is the text that users see displayed
        on the page.
    </p>
    <p> Syntax for making hyperlinks : </p>
    <ul>
      <li> There is a space between a and href </li>
      <li> There are no spaces aroung the = </li>
      <li> The website has two " around it </li>
      <li> There are no spaces between the href attribute and the opening tag </li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Images </h2>

    <p> An image element does not need a closing tag (also called void elements) </p>

    <p> The source attribute, src, is like the href of a link - it is the URL of the
        image we want to display.
        For now, our images will need to be hosted online, which means that the URL
        will need to start with http:// or https://.
        The alt attribute stands for "alternative description", which is important
        for people who use screen readers to browse the web. This is the text that will
        show up lieu of the actual image.

    <h2> A Guide to Paths </h2>

    <p> In order to display a local image, we need to be able to write a path </p>
    <span> A path is a way of describing where a file is stored </span>

    <p> As a web developer, we need to consider two essential domains for paths: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> Paths to find files on your computer, <strong> local </strong> files </li>
          <li> Paths to find files on other computers, <strong> external </strong> files </li>
        </ol>

    <h3> Local Paths </h3>
    <p> Computers have folders (also called "directories"). Operating systems like Windows,
        Mac and Linux organize all of the files into a tree of directories called a
        <strong> file system </strong>.
        There's a top-most directory, often called the <strong> root </strong>, that
        contains all of the other directories.
        Within the root, there are files and directories. Withing those directories are
        more files and directories and so on.
    </p>

    <p> Every file has an address, which we call the "path". An absolute path is written
        in relation to the computer's root directory.
        For instance, a file in the Documents folder on a Mac has a path that looks like:
        "/Users/Hetansh/Documents/file.txt"
    </p>

    <p> file.txt is stored inside Documents/.
        Users/, Hetansh/ and Documents/ are all names of directories.
        Documents/ lives inside Hetansh/ and Hetansh/ lives inside Users/.
        Users/ is inside the root directory, which is represented by the first "/".
        The rest of the "/" are used to separate directories.
    </p>

    <p> When we open an HTML file in the browser, we're seeing the absolute path to the
        file on the computer. </p>
    <span> file:///Users/hetanshmehta/Desktop/HTML:CSS%20Basics.html </span>
    <p> file:// is called the protocol and the rest is the absolute path to index.html.
        This URL will only work for you on your computer. As no one else has your file system,
        this URL is unique to your computer.

    <h3> External Paths </h3>
    <p> The process of leading a website from a URL like https://www.google.com
        mimics opening an HTML file that is saved on the computer. Every Website
        starts with an HTML file. It just so happens that when we visit a website,
        the HTML file that we want to open lives on a different computer.
        The computer responsible for giving the website's files is called a
        <strong> server </strong>
      </p>

    <p> Pointing your browser to hrrps://www.google.com sends a request to
        Google's server for the HTML file (and others) that your computer needs
        to load the Google website.
        We can think of google.com as the root path of google/s server (computer)
        that anyone can access.
        The google server exposes the files to the web, which means that they
        make them available to anyone who wants them.
        Servers have <strong> external path </strong> that anyone can access and is the reason why the web works.
      </p>

    <p> There are different <strong> protocols </strong> for serving files,
        the most common of which on the web are HTTP and HTTPS.
        Opening the file on your own computer uses the FILE protocol.
    </p>
