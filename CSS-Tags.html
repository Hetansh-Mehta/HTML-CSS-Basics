    <h1> CSS Basics </h1>



    <ul>

      <li> <p> CSS: Cascading Syle Sheets is the markup language that we use to
               describe how elements on website look.
               It gives us the ability to change the way elements look.
          </p>
      </li>

      <li> <p> Things that can be controlled: </p>
            <ol>
              <li> Colour </li>
              <li> Font </li>
              <li> Spacing </li>
              <li> Layout </li>
            </ol>
      </li>

      <li> <p> It lets us separate the description of the content we want on
               the page (HTML) from the description of how we want the content
               to look on the page (CSS).
               Literally all the code that makes the page loog the way it does,
               is separate from the text, images, and content that is on the page.
           </p>
      </li>

    </ul>


    <h2> CSS RULESETS </h2

      <h3> TAGS </h3>

      <p> A sample ruleset: </p>
      <span> div{ </span>
      <span>  text-align: right; </span>
      <span> }


      <ul>
        <li> <p> A ruleset is made up of two parts: </p>
          <ol>
            <li> <strong> A Selector (div): </strong> which is the code that
                selects the HTML elements you want to style. </li>
            <li> <strong> Declaration block { #statements }: </strong>
                 which is the code that describes the styles you want to apply
                 to said HTML. Declarations are the lines of code written
                 inside the curly braces.</li>
          </ol>
        </li>

        <li> <p> The head contains the meta-data of the page. Style is one of
                 the pieces of information that goes inside the head.
                 Anything that goes inside the style tags is CSS.
             </p>
        </li>

        <li> <p> Let us consider the set: p { colour: blue; } </p>
             <ul>
               <li> <em> <strong> p (tag selector) </strong> </em> is telling the browser
                    to select all the <em> <strong> p </strong> </em> tags,
                    or paragraph tags of the page.
               </li>
               <li> <em> <strong> {colour: blue;} (declaration) </strong> <em>
                    colour is the property we wanna change and blue is the value
                    we pass to it.

               </li>
               <li> The value describes how the browser should render the
                    property for the element. Properties are always written
                    in plain English. And they identify a feature of an HTML
                    element that we want to change.
               </li>

          <li> <p> NOTE THAT using p{} tag selector, we can only select ALL the
               paragraph tags. To specifically select a paragraph, we use attributes.
               </p>
          </li>
      </ul>
