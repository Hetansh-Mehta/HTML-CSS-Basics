    <p class="introductory para"> A stylesheet is a file containing the code that describes how elements
        on your webpage should be displayed. It is similar to styling the
        HTML document, except the CSS lives in a different file. So we now
        don't have to use the style tags anymore.
    </p>
    <p class="introductory para"> To create a stylesheet, simply add a new file to your project,
        write some CSS, and save it as "name-of-stylesheet.css"
    </p>

  <div class="link to a stylesheet">
    <h2 class="header2"> Link to a Stylesheet </h2>
    <p class="linker para"> Before the webpage can use the stylesheet, we need to link it to
        the HTML file.
        To create a link, we simply type the following inside the "head"
        of the HTML file:
    </p>
    <p> <em> link href="path-to-stylesheet/stylesheet.css" rel="Stylesheet" </em>
    </p>
    <p class="linker para"> The <em> "href" </em> attribute specifies the <strong> path </strong>
        to the linked resource and the <em>"rel"</em> attribute names the
        <strong> relationship </strong> between the resource and the
        document. In this case, the relationship is a stylesheet.
