    <h2> Attributes Used </h2>
    <p> Attributes used are: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> id="site-description" </li>
      <li> class="player-summary" </li>
    </ol>

    <p> Attributes are very important as they: </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Help us describe the content of the page inside the HTML markup.
    </ul>

    <p class="first"> <strong> NOTE: </strong> IDs should be used sparingly as an HTML
        element can have only one ID and IDs can be used once a page.
        <strong> ALSO </strong> If you want to add the same attribute
        to multiple HTML elements, use classes.
        Classes can be added to multiple HTML element and an HTML element
        can have multiple classes.
        class="highlight module player-summary" is basically assigning 3
        different classes to the element. This also works (order doesn't matter).

    <h2> CSS Units of Measurement </h2>

    <p class="second"> In CSS, we use units like pixels and percentages for measurement.
        Furthermore, Units can be categorised into two parts:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li> <strong> Absolute Units </strong> <p> Units that refer to fixed
           units of measurement.
           Example: pixels, mm, in, cm </p>
      </li>

      <li> <strong> Relative Units </strong> <p> Units that are a comparison
           to another linked property.
           Example: percentages, em, vw (viewport width), vh(viewport height) </p>
      </li>

      <li> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length">
           Full list of units</a>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <!-- .sidebar{                      The property width is being passed
              width: 400px;             the value of 400 pixels
          }
  }-->

    <h2> Adding Color to Websites </h2>

    <p> While writing CSS, we express color by specifying the amount of
        red, green, and blue light that should be present. This can be done
        in two ways: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> <p> <strong> RGB </strong> Each amount of red, green and blue
           light is written as a decimal number between 0 and 255.
           0 being the lowest value or no presence of light and 255 being
           the highest value or 100% presence of the light. </p>

           <p>Example: body{
                      background-color: rgb(255,0,255);
                    }</p>
            <p> This will change the background color to magenta. </p>
       </li>

       <li> <p> <strong> Hexadecimal or hex </strong> Each amount of red, green,
            and blue light is written as a hexadecimal number between the
            values 00 and FF.
            00, which is just 0 in decimal, and FF, which is just 255 in decimal
            </p>

            <p> Example: body{
                            background-color: #ff00ff
                         }
            </p>
            <p> The # sign tells the browser that hexadecimal is being used. </p>
       </li>
         
    </ol>
